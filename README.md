# Unary JavaScript

Only unary function, for the good of FP in JS.

⚠️DO NOT USE IN PROD⚠️

## Description

Unary JS is a pedagocical attempt to demonstrate functional programming concept in JavaScript.
The idea is to stick to **pure unary functions** to do any kind of computation.

This implies there is no more operator or control structure in the langage, 
but only first class functions, composing and combining.

For example, iterations are always made by recursion and so on.
But a big problem prevent JS to become efficient on intensive iteration with this approach.
Even in TCO is part of ES6, only Safari implements it. [Neither V8 or SpiderMonkey have TCO anymore)](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-ptc-syntax) so chrome, node.js and safari can't ensure a good execution of this library: don't use it in production

## Utility

- make a definitive pack of 1000 tiny functions that can handle 99.99% of Computer Science Problem
- make JS more LISP-like, Elm-like
- discover lambda calculus
- discover category theory
